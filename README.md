# HopCat Tapper

The HopCat Tapper is used to find out how to get the most bang for your buck at HopCat. As a college student, I wanted to make a program that helped users living on a budget find a way to get the most out of their beers.

**Note:** *This only checks for beers on tap, no bottles currently*

**PLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY**

## Getting Started
First, install MongoDB and run it with the `mongod` command. 

Next, install the requirements by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run the program with:

`python web.py`

The website should be running on localhost:5000 at this point!
